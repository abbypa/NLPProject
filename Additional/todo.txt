- update duckduckgo to grade "regular" word
- normalize each classifier (maybe using "normal word")
- connect classifier to tokenizer (+ try to enlarge window)
- init all classifiers in main (not everytime we search)
- add sleep between searches (currently 1 second beforeprocessing a new line maybe it should be done more often?)
- more classifers- save words before hits
- tokenizer optimizations ('-)
- installation script
