- installation script
- config.py- facebook limit & bounds
- full language support- different cache, different duckduck keywords, different facebook categories(?)
- cache violation when no period in the line end (see tourist1.txt)


- before submitting
    - after more runs (to find bugs)- surround all api calls with try-except and return an empty result
    - decide on facebook access token
    - remove todo's, prints, extra files
    - check on nova


- book:
    - general framework & tokenizer
    - for each classifier- description, technology & alg, small experiment (words)
    - issues from mail and in general (google, facebook user token, how to identify a normal word, languages...)
    - optimizations- cache, stop words, window enlargement, person names
    - experiments- learning & calibrating
        - corpus- different texts (tourism, pop culture, news, wikipedia)- 3 each for training (2 for testing)
        - run with different weights (including one classifier running), compare to stanford
            - normalize some of the limits in config, accordingly
        - large corpus?
        - 2 working points (optimised weights)- normal texts, lower texts
        - try different n-grams
            - on 1-gram, celebrity name will match only if one name matches first
    - test- 2 texts each
        - run result weights on test files
        - same experiment with all lower case, and with all upper case
        - different ngrams
    - another language?- try in our system, if not- show premise from google
    - conclusion- scale out options (google, added data...)
