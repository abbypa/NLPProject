Our national monuments are truly spectacular and “must see” attractions when visiting the nation’s capital. Among the most popular are the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial and Vietnam Memorial and the World War II Memorial.

See a guide to the Best Sightseeing Tours in Washington DC. The memorials are beautiful at night when they are illuminated. Many of them are open 24 hours and offer great views of the city. Arlington National Cemetery, located just across the Potomac River, is also a prime place to visit and home to dozens of memorials including the Coast Guard Memorial, the Space Shuttle Challenger Memorial, Spanish-American War Memorial, and more.
