Our national monuments are truly spectacular and “must see” attractions when visiting the nation’s capital. Among the most popular are the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial and Vietnam Memorial and the World War II Memorial. They are spread out throughout the city and can be difficult to see on foot. The best way to see the major monuments is to take a guided tour - you won’t have to negotiate congested city traffic and you will learn a lot of interesting facts about our national heroes.

Tours range from hop-on-off trolley tours to bike tours to moonlight tours. See a guide to the Best Sightseeing Tours in Washington DC.  Informative park ranger talks and junior ranger programs are also available.

The memorials are beautiful at night when they are illuminated. Many of them are open 24 hours and offer great views of the city. Arlington National Cemetery, located just across the Potomac River, is also a prime place to visit and home to dozens of memorials including the Coast Guard Memorial, the Space Shuttle Challenger Memorial, Spanish-American War Memorial, and more.
