lebron james won’t commit to play for team usa at rio olympics

lebron james is in las vegas for a team usa minicamp, but that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s a lock for rio next year.

as noted by kurt helin of nbc sports, the 30-year-old james has played in five straight nba finals and already is ninth on the nba’s all-time minutes list if you count the regular season, playoffs and international play. he’ll probably move up to seventh on that list after next year.

should he decide to suit up, it would be james’s fourth appearance for team usa. only teofilio cruz (puerto rico), andrew gaze (australia) and oscar schmidt (brazil) have competed in more.
