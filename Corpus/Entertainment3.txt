Jon Stewart ended his 16-year, 2,600-episode run on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show” Thursday night with a celeb- and tear-filled 50 minutes featuring show alums Stephen Colbert, Steve Carrell and future “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah.
Those who’ve been zinged by Stewart over the years also had their (tongue-in-cheek) final say, including Sen. John McCain, Bill O’Reilly and even Arby’s CEO Paul Brown (“It’s like your TV threw up on your face,” Brown joked about Stewart’s show). Bruce Springsteen closed with “Land of Hope and Dreams.”
Stewart’s finale averaged 3.5 million viewers — only the second-most-watched show during his tenure. His interview with then-presidential candidate Barack Obama in October 2008 averaged 3.6 million viewers.

FX announced Friday that comedian Louis CK is taking a long hiatus from his popular, Emmy-winning sitcom “Louie” — attributing the break to scheduling issues.
(CK is exec-producing three projects for FX including “Baskets” and “Better Things.”)
FX chief Jon Landgraf estimated CK’s hiatus to last anywhere from six months to two years (!), and it’s not the first time the comedian has taken time off from his sitcom — he was away for nearly two years between Seasons 3 and 4.

Fox’s hit series “Empire” is making a lot of news as it prepares to launch its second season Sept. 23.
First, series creator Lee Daniels said that pop diva Mariah Carey — who was getting her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame — will appear on Season 2 in an unspecified role. Fox declined to comment on that one.
Then, the very next day, Fox announced that rapper Pitbull will appear in Season 2, both as a guest star and as a performer.
The hip-hop drama was last season’s breakout success with stars Terrence Howard, Emmy nominee Taraji P. Henson, Jussie Smollett, Trai Beyers and Bryshere Gray.
