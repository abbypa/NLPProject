At a press conference held at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Herzliya on Monday night, pop superstar Mariah Carey discussed her upcoming sell-out concert and her love of Israel.

Carey, 45 told reporters that she is excited to be back in Israel, adding that the tour was planned during her visit in June this year.

“I haven’t toured a lot in my life and I came here with my boyfriend James Packer a month ago and it was so exciting to be here that I decided I wanted to come back here and do a show,” she said.

The singer, who is traveling with her two children Moroccan and Monroe, spoke briefly about how motherhood has changed her life. “I would say it’s the best thing that’s every happened to me and music. It effected everything, it changes how I live my life entirely, and it’s the focus of who I am entirely. It changes the way I sleep, the way I live.”

Carey, a strong supporter of Israel, claims that she did not feel any pressure from critics of Israel or the BDS movement before coming to do the show. “Nobody tried to pressure me, I did hear about it but I do what I want to do. I’ve always wanted to come here. I don’t care what other people’s political agendas are. I’m just an entertainer and I’m here. I’m happy to be here and I’m honored to be here.”

The concert is going to be a simple yet artistic show with just a band and singers accompanying Carey. She describes the production as bare-boned and very different to her current show in Las Vegas.

Carey’s Australian billionaire boyfriend James Packer accompanied her.
